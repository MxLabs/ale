# How To Contribute

Five simple steps:

1. Create a [GitLab Issue](https://gitlab.com/kode4food/ale/issues)
   to propose and discuss your potential contribution.

2. Fork our [Git Repository](https://gitlab.com/kode4food/ale)

3. Issue an empty pull request.

4. Push change sets as they're committed, accompanied by unit and integration
   tests (test coverage should not drop). We will keep our eyes on the
   changes as they arrive to ensure that the final review goes smoothly.

5. When you're ready, label the pull request as "Ready for Review"
